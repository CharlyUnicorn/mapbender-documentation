Search Router
***********************

Search frontend GUI for plugable search engine modules. Right now a generic SQL search engine
is provided, with more to come (think Lucene enhanced search, etc.)

Configuration
=============

.. image:: ../../../../../figures/search_router_configuration.png
     :scale: 80

You need a button to show this element. See :doc:`button` for inherited configuration options.

The SearcRouter needs access to the database where the search tables are. You have to define a new database configuration to be able to connect with the geo database. Read more about this at http://doc.mapbender3.org/en/book/database.html

You can define Searches (Routes) with the + Button. Each Search has a titel which will show up in the search form in a selectbox where you can choose the search you want to use.

The definition of the search is done in YAML syntax in the textarea configuration. Here you define the database connection, the Search tables/views, the desihn of the form and of the result table.

Element definition in web interface in the configuration area:

                       maxScale: ~

Compare modes
-------------

Each field can be assigned a compare mode which is evaluated by the engine when building the search query. The SQL search
engine has the following modes:

* exact: exact comparison (key = val)
* iexact: case-insensitive comparison
* like: default, uses two-sided like
* like-left: uses left-sided like
* like-right: uses right-sided like
* **ilike**: uses two-sided case-insensitive like
* ilike-left: uses left-sided case-insensitive like
* ilike-right: uses right-sided case-insensitive like


Result feature styling
----------------------

By default, the result features are styled using the default styles OpenLayers provides. This gives the
well-known orange look and blue look for the selected feature. If you want to override that, you can
provide a styleMap configuration for the results like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    results:
        styleMap:
            default:
                fillOpacity: 0
            select:
                fillOpacity: 0.4

This will not draw polygon interiors, but only their outlines in default mode. The selected feature will
have it's interior drawn with 60% transparency.

The default style properties will override the properties OpenLayers uses for the default style, therefore
you only need to set properties you wish to change. If you omit the default part, OpenLayers default style
will be used as is.

A similar logic applies to the select style â€“ any property you provide will override the corresponding
property of the *final* default style. Therefore the example above will *not* yield a blue look for the
selected feature!

Keep in mind to quote hex color codes as the pound sign will otherwise be treated as a inline comment!

A more elaborate example with green (hollow) features and the selected one in red:

.. code-block:: yaml

    results:
        styleMap:
            default:
                strokeColor: '#00ff00'
                strokeOpacity: 1
                fillOpacity: 0
            select:
                strokeColor: '#ff0000'
                fillColor: '#ff0000'
                fillOpacity: 0.4
