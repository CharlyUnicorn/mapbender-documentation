Git-based installation
######################

If you want to participate in the Mapbender3 development or for some other
reasons want to use the Git repositories from Mapbender3, follow this guide
instead of the normal download. This guide is based on Ubuntu 12.04. For
other distributions, you may need to adapt, especially package names like
sphinx-common.

First check the prerequisites at `Installation <systemrequirements.html>`_. 

For git-based installations you also need:

* git     - have a look at the `Quick primer on using Git <../development/git.html>`_ to get familiar with git 
* cURL    - command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting HTTP, HTTPS and more
* pear    - PHP Extension and Application Repository 
* Phing   - `Phing <http://www.phing.info/>`_ Is Not GNU make; it's a PHP project build system or build tool based on â€‹Apache Ant.
* php5-dev - Of course the files for PHP5 module development.


Cloning the Repository
**********************

Get the code from the git repository. Cloning is easy, just issue the following command in your shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter.git mapbender3
    cd mapbender3

Developers granted secure access to the code must use the SSH-URL of the
repository: git@github.com:mapbender/mapbender-starter


Change to a tag of a Mapbender3 release
***************************************

To work with a release version of Mapbender3 change to the specific tag. For version 3.0.5.0 for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    git tag -l
    git checkout v3.0.5.0


Fetching the Submodules
***********************

The starter application does not include the Mapbender3 bundles, these are
kept in a repository of their own and are included as a submodule of the
starter repository. To fetch them, issue the following command at the root
directory of your cloned repository:


.. code-block:: bash

	git submodule update --init --recursive


cURL
====

Our build system uses cURL to fetch some remote components, therefore you need
to install the cURL command line tool:


.. code-block:: yaml

	sudo apt-get install curl

.. _phing:



Build management using Phing
****************************

Build management is done using `Phing` which is installed using Pear. So, first
we need to get Pear, we are assuming a Debian-based system here:


.. code-block:: yaml

	sudo apt-get install php-pear


We then tell Pear where to autodiscover it's repositories and for good measure,
update Pear:


.. code-block:: yaml

    sudo pear config-set auto_discover 1
    sudo pear upgrade-all
      Enable full APC compatibility [yes] : yes
      Enable internal debugging in APCu [no] : yes 


Then let's get Phing:


.. code-block:: yaml

    sudo pear channel-discover pear.phing.info 
    sudo pear install phing/phing


Composer and PHPUnit
====================

PHPUnit is delivered with Composer. Our build scripts need some more dependencies to run unit test, generate
documentation and build installation packages.

Once you have installed the dependencies listed below, you can get an overview
of available build tasks by issuing


.. code-block:: yaml

   phing -l

The first task you want to - actually need to - execute is the deps task, which
uses `Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_ to install the runtime dependencies like
Symfony and Doctrine:

So, first install Composer (more information at http://getcomposer.org/download/):

.. code-block:: yaml

    cd application
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php


Create a configuration file called parameters.yml. Copy the file application/app/config/parameters.yml.dist.


.. code-block:: bash

  cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml

Please read the chapter `Adapting the configuration file <configuration.html#adapting-the-configuration-file>`_ for details about the adjustments in the parameters.yml file.

  
And afterwards get the runtime dependencies like Symfony and Doctrine:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ./composer.phar update 


Next steps from Installation
****************************

Now follow the steps that are described in  `Installation <installation_ubuntu.html>`_:

**Notice:** Please note that the git based code has an additional directory *application* (mapbender3/application/...). 

* Adapting the configuration file parameters.yml
* Creating the database
* Creating the database schema
* Copying/Linking the bundles' assets to the public web directory
* Initializing the role system
* Creating the "root" user
* Inserting srs parameters
* Inserting of applications from mapbender.yml into the database


Refer to web with a symbolic link
**********************************
As a developer, you might want to use the symlink switch on that command to
symlink instead of copy. This will make editing assets inside the bundle
directories way easier

.. code-block:: yaml

    app/console assets:install web --symlink --relative


Please notice that you might have to activate the :command:`FollowSymLinks` option to your apache Directory like this:


.. code-block:: yaml

  Alias /mapbender3 /var/www/mapbender3/web/
  <Directory /var/www/mapbender3/web/>
    Options MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    DirectoryIndex app.php
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /mapbender3/
    RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ app.php/$1 [PT,L,QSA]
 </Directory>


Learn more about app/console
****************************
The Symfony Console Component makes it possible to create command-line commands. Doctrine for example comes with a couple of command-line commands you can use.

Read more in the Symfony documentation about `Console Commands <http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/usage.html>`_.

Here are some commands to help to find information:

.. code-block:: yaml

 app/console                        - lists all assets
 app/console help                   - displays help
 app/console help list              - displays help for a special command
 app/console doctrine               - lists all functions from Doctrine 
 app/console mapbender              - lists all functions from mapbender 
 app/console help assets:install    - help for a special command

Learn how to generate Mapbender elements with *app/console mapbender:generate:element* at `How to create your own Element? <../development/element_generate.html>`_.

 Package Build Tools
 ===================

 TODO: Skipped for now, KMQ has the knowledge.

Update your installation
========================
As development goes on you want to stay up-to-date with the code on github. 

There are following steps you have to do to stay up-to-date

* get the code from the mapbender-starter repository
* update the submodules 
* update your database so that new structures (tables, columns) will be created


.. code-block:: yaml
 
 cd mapbender-starter
 git pull
 git submodule update --init --recursive
 cd application
 ./composer.phar update --dev 
 app/console doctrine:schema:update


.. _installation_sphinx:

Sphinx
======

Sphinx is used to build the documentation you are reading right now. On Debian-
based systems, you can use apt to install Sphinx:


.. code-block:: yaml

   sudo apt-get install sphinx-common


You find the Mapbender3 documentation at github at mapbender-documentation. Get the clone like this: 

.. code-block:: yaml

	git clone git://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-documentation

Developers granted secure access to the code must use the SSH-URL of the
repository: git@github.com:mapbender/mapbender-documentation

Read more about `How to write Mapbender3 Documentation? <../development/documentation_howto.html>`_.

ApiGen
======

`ApiGen <http://apigen.org>`_ is our API documentation generator of choice. It can also be installed using Pear, so use the following command:


.. code-block:: yaml
    
	 sudo pear install pear.apigen.org/apigen

Read more about `How to write Mapbender3 API Documentation? <../development/apidocumentation.html>`_.


Troubleshooting
***************

* The ApiGen task only works with recent versions of Phing (>= 2.4.12). Check the Phing version with:


.. code-block:: bash

              phing -v


You can update all your Pear packages with


.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pear upgrade-all
      Enable full APC compatibility [yes] : yes
      Enable internal debugging in APCu [no] : yes 

      
..
   Using the quick_install.py script
   *********************************

   A Python script to quickly install a mapbender-starter is provided with the
   mapbender-starter itself. You can download that script, which offers a number
   of command line arguments:

   - branch: by default, the develop branch is used, but you can specify any branch
   - directory: by default the directory mapbender3_BRANCH will be used, but that
     can be specified as well.
   - admin user: the default admin account (root <root@example.com> / root) can be
     changed as well.

   You can download the script or just pass it's URL to curl to fetch it and pipe
   the result trough Python. The later is demonstrated in the examples section
   below.

   Examples
   ========

   http://bit.ly/1tQvo5i is the shortened URL for
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/develop/bin/quick_install.py

   - Install develop branch into mapbender3_develop

     .. code-block:: sh

       curl -sSL http://bit.ly/1tQvo5i | python

   - Install foo branch into /tmp/bar

     .. code-block:: sh

       curl -sSL http://bit.ly/1tQvo5i | python - --dir=/tmp/bar foo

   - Install develop branch, but use admin <admin@example.com> with password admin

     .. code-block:: sh

       curl -sSL http://bit.ly/1tQvo5i | python - --username=admin --email=admin@example.com --password=admin
