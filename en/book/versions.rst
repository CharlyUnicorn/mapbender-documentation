Milestone 3.0.5.0
-----------------

Release Date: xx-05-2015

For details have a look at:  https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md

* **WMS reload:** WMS sources can now be reloaded if the structure has changed.

* **Digitizer:** The digitizer allows the editing of geometries and their attributes. Right now it needs access to the database where the editable tables are. The definition of the digitizer is done in YAML syntax. To provide an usable interface for the attributes, you can declare the form in your configuration file. The form supports different input fields (textboxes, checkboxes, date-pickers, and so on..), validation, tabs and it uses Bootstrap.

* **Print with legend:** The print element supports the print-out of the legend on a seperate page. This can be set with a checkbox.

* **Configurable layertree:** The layertree supports the usage of more than one layerset. You have to adjust the map element to define which layersets should be shown and the layertree element itself. The usage is documented at [13].

* **Improved FeatureInfo dialog:** You can set a) the width and height of the FeatureInfo dialog, b) if the dialog should show the original format of the WMS and c) if it should only open if a valid entry is found (otherwise a messagebox is displayed). See the documentation at [15].

* **Mobile template:** A new modern mobile template is provided.

* **SASS Compiler:** Architectual changes are made at the SASS compiler which leads to a more performant interface.

* **Vendor Specific Parameters:** A WMS layer instance supports the definition of Vendor Specific Parameters that are added to the WMS request. You can define hard coded values or the user or group information of the logged-in user. See the documentation at [14] for details.

* **Expanded functionality of HTML elements with a form-builder:** This approach is used in the Digitizer to provide the forms for attribute editing.

* **New button colletion:** The new buttons are based on a new font, the old buttons are available under the "FontAwesome" name.

* **Starting mapbender with URL parameters:** Mapbender3 can be started with URL parameters. See the documentation at [16]

* Symfony updated to 2.3.29.


**Changes in config.yml:**

* Changes in a dbal connection:
  
  * **logging: false**: This options sets, that *all* SQL statements are not logged. Further information can be found here: http://www.loremipsum.at/blog/doctrine-2-sql-profiler-in-debugleiste/

  * **profiling: false**: This option handles the profiling of SQL statements. This option can be switched off in production environments.

  If possible the options should be set this way, so that they are only active in debug mode:

  .. code-block:: yaml

                  logging:               "%kernel.debug%"
                  profiling:             "%kernel.debug%" 


**Known Issues**

* After copying an application from Mapbender 3.0.4.x you have to set the layerset in the map/overview element.
