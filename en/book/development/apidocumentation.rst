How to write Mapbender3 API Documentation?
*******************************************

PHP
~~~~~~

`ApiGen <http://apigen.org>`_ is used to generate API documentation. 'All' you
have to do is to insert docblocks in your code. Below you find an example class
with docbblock annotations:

.. literalinclude:: Example.php
    :language: html+php
    :linenos:

Have a look at the docblocks at `Example.php <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-documentation/blob/master/de/book/development/Example.php>`_.
