API documentation
#################

PHP
***

`ApiGen <http://apigen.org>`_ is used to generate API documentation. 'All' you
have to do is to insert docblocks in your code. Below you find an example class
with docbblock annotations:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/Mapbender/Example.php
    :language: html+php
    :linenos:

You can check the `generated documentation <../../../../../../apidoc/class-Mapbender.Example.html>`_.
